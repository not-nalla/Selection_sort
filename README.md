# Selection Sort

Selection Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It works by repeatedly selecting the smallest element from the unsorted portion of the array and placing it at the beginning.

## How Selection Sort Works
1. Divide the array into two parts:  
   - Sorted part (initially empty)  
   - Unsorted part (entire array)
2. Find the minimum element in the unsorted part.
3. Swap it with the first element of the unsorted part.
4. Move the boundary of the sorted part one step forward.
5. Repeat until the array is fully sorted.
